    <h1>Articles of Incorporation</h1>
    <h2>Valfar and Sons Underdark Surveyors Inc.</h2>

    <p><em>Be it known to all persons, creatures, and entities of sound mind and body, whether of surface or
            subterranean dwelling, that on this day, the 17th of Mirtul, in the Year of the Vigilant Vole, under the
            auspices of His Most Exalted Deepness, Horgar Steelshadow V, Duergar King of Gracklstugh, the following
            articles are hereby set forth and declared:</em></p>

    <h3>Article the First: Nomenclature and Domicile</h3>

    <p>Whereas it hath been deemed meet and proper by the undersigned parties, that a company of mercantile and
        exploratory nature should be established within the bounds of the great and indomitable city of Gracklstugh, let
        it be known that such an enterprise shall henceforth be recognized and addressed as <strong>Valfar and Sons
            Underdark Surveyors Inc.</strong>, hereinafter referred to as "the Company" or "said Company" in all matters
        pertaining to its dealings, both mundane and extraordinary.</p>

    <h3>Article the Second: Purpose and Endeavours</h3>

    <p>The Company, being of sound constitution and possessed of a spirit of adventure tempered by prudence, doth hereby
        declare its intent to engage in sundry activities within the vast and perilous realms of the Underdark,
        including but not limited to:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The meticulous and judicious survey of subterranean resources, be they mineral, fungal, or of a nature yet
            unknown to the eyes of mortal or immortal beings.</li>
        <li>The facilitation and execution of mercantile pursuits upon the treacherous waters of the Darklake, including
            the transport and exchange of goods, wares, and sundry items of value.</li>
        <li>The identification, classification, and valuation of rare and wondrous minerals secreted within the bowels
            of the earth, employing methods both arcane and mundane.</li>
        <li>The cartographic representation of routes, passages, and byways that wind their way through the labyrinthine
            depths of the Underdark, with due consideration given to the ever-changing nature of such thoroughfares.
        </li>
        <li>The provision of diplomatic services and counsel in matters pertaining to negotiations with the enigmatic
            and oft-capricious Drow, with the utmost care taken to preserve life, limb, and dignity of all parties
            involved.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Article the Third: Governance and Hierarchy</h3>

    <p>The Company shall be governed by a council of no less than three and no more than seven individuals, chosen from
        among the most esteemed and experienced members of the Valfar lineage. The patriarch or matriarch of said
        lineage shall, by right of blood and tradition, serve as the Chief Surveyor and principal decision-maker in all
        matters of import.</p>

    <p>Subordinate to the council shall be a cadre of master surveyors, each responsible for the oversight and execution
        of one or more of the Company's primary endeavours as outlined in Article the Second. These master surveyors
        shall, in turn, command teams of journeymen and apprentices, the exact number and composition of which shall be
        determined by the exigencies of each undertaking.</p>

    <h3>Article the Fourth: Distribution of Profits and Losses</h3>

    <p>All profits accrued through the lawful and diligent pursuit of the Company's stated endeavours shall be
        distributed in the following manner:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Three-fifths (3/5) shall be retained by the Company for the purpose of reinvestment, acquisition of
            equipment and supplies, and the maintenance of a prudent reserve against future misfortunes.</li>
        <li>One-fifth (1/5) shall be distributed among the members of the governing council, in proportions to be
            determined by said council.</li>
        <li>One-fifth (1/5) shall be distributed among the master surveyors and their subordinates, in a manner
            befitting their rank and contributions to the Company's success.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the event of losses incurred through misfortune, poor judgment, or the capricious nature of the Underdark
        itself, such losses shall be borne by the Company as a whole, with each member contributing to their
        amelioration in proportion to their stake in the enterprise.</p>

    <h3>Article the Fifth: Dissolution and Succession</h3>

    <p>Should it come to pass that the Company must be dissolved, whether through catastrophe, loss of royal favour, or
        the unanimous decision of the governing council, all assets and liabilities shall be divided among the surviving
        members in a manner consistent with their contributions and standing within the Company.</p>

    <p>In matters of succession, preference shall be given to direct descendants of the Valfar lineage, provided they
        have demonstrated the requisite skills, knowledge, and temperament to assume leadership of the Company. Should
        no suitable heir be found within the Valfar line, the governing council shall have the authority to select a
        successor from among the most capable and trustworthy of the master surveyors.</p>

    <h3>Article the Sixth: Seal and Ratification</h3>

    <p>Let these Articles of Incorporation be sealed with the mark of Valfar and Sons Underdark Surveyors Inc., a device
        depicting a stalactite crossed with a surveyor's rod, encircled by a chain of precious gems.</p>

    <p>In witness whereof, we, the undersigned, do hereby affix our marks and seals, binding ourselves and our heirs to
        the faithful execution of these articles, on this 17th day of Mirtul, in the Year of the Vigilant Vole.</p>

    <p><em>[Seal of Valfar and Sons Underdark Surveyors Inc.]</em></p>

    <p>Signed,</p>
